    "There are several different ways to run Python scripts.  A common way for developers (especially Unix users) is to use a text-based terminal called a \"shell\" to run Python from the command line.  This method is very powerful but lacks handy interactive features like viewing plots of your data.  \n",

    "You might also use an interactive Python gui, called \"iPython\", to run scripts.  This has the major advantage of combining computational power with visualizations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, many professionals are turning to Jupyter to run Python in user-friendly, interactive Notebooks.  It allows you to write notebooks similar to Mathematica, SageMath, etc.  The advantage of doing this is that you can include text, equations, code, and plots in the same document, and it is easy to share them with others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install Jupyter is through the Anaconda package (https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  I will use the Jupyter Notebook format throughout this course.  Once you download Anaconda, you should also be able to run Python from your default shell, and it also includes an iPython environment called Spyder.  So you get all of the options with no additional trouble!"
